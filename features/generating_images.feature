#   #As an optometry student
#   #I want to be able to see the images generated from the Zernike equation
#   #so I can study imperfections of the eye
  
# Scenario: save images as a zip file
#   When I go to "the home page"
#   And I click "save as zip file"
#   Then I should see "Successfully downloaded zip file"
